# SkyrimChallengeJson
This software is used for a challenge a friend came up with.
I made this program to give myself some more experience in the language, as well to use it for its' purpouse.

If you want to compile this yourself all you need is the following

--- Visual studio 2019
--- NewtonsoftJson.Net Nuget


This program is made to be configurable by basically anyone.
Whn you first start your program, you might notice 4 new files being created in the json format.
data.json, setupConig.json, alternativeSetupConig.json and characterconfig.json

data.json ::: This is some basic program storage, like paths to different files, except the data.json. It will always be the same directory as the executable.
setupConig.json ::: In here is the configuration to what you want the possible follower locations ,objectives, races and such to be.
alternativeSetupConfig.json ::: This is an alternative, the reason is to show off the rest of the features. Look at the last objective "Kill ebony knight"
characterConfig.json ::: This is your character. Objectives you have finished an so on.
